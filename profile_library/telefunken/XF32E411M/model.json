These apply only to picture default profiles, customized profiles may differ.\nSwitching Sat channels lowers power by ~5W for 2-3 seconds, which Powercalc cannot account for.Thus, this profile is not recommended for Sat use. Other tuners were not tested.\nUSB devices can increase TV power consumption by up to 7W.",

  "measure_description": "Measurements were taken in several scenarios with different picture profiles. Tested were: playing this YouTube video via the internal YouTube player and via a connected device over HDMI: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FsYk9GIv2Y&t=1781s, and watching channels via the Sat tuner. The TV is an LCD and shows very consistent power consumption across all profiles, so a calculation is possible.",
