  "measure_description": "Measurements were taken in several scenarios with different picture profiles. Tested were: playing this YouTube video via the internal YouTube player and via a connected device over HDMI: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FsYk9GIv2Y&t=1781s, and watching channels via the Sat tuner. The TV is an LCD and shows very consistent power consumption across all profiles, so a calculation is possible.",

These apply only to picture default profiles, customized profiles may differ.\nSwitching Sat channels lowers power by ~5W for 2-3 seconds, which Powercalc cannot account for.Thus, this profile is not recommended for Sat use. Other tuners were not tested.\nUSB devices can increase TV power consumption by up to 7W.\n Standby power was measured with network standby off, with network standby on, power consumption is higher.",
