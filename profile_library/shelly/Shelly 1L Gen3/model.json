Firmware version 1.7.1 for the tested Shelly 1L Gen3 device. The power values are long-term averages measured while the device periodically wakes to maintain connectivity. Instantaneous power is higher during wakeups when the relay is off, but the average energy consumption is accurately reflected.",
