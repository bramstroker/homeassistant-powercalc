# Contributing

There are several ways to contribute to Powercalc.
You can help with the providing new measurements, development, documentation, translations, or by creating tutorials and videos.
Every contribution is welcome!

## [Measuring / Submitting Power Profiles](measure/measure.md)

Help expand the library of supported devices by measuring and submitting power profiles. This involves:

- Using a supported smartplug to measure power consumption of devices at different settings
- Following the measurement process with our measurement script
- Preparing and submitting the data via a Pull Request

Accurate power profiles are the foundation of Powercalc, making this one of the most valuable ways to contribute.

## [Integration Development](integration-development.md)

Contribute to the codebase by:

- Setting up a development environment
- Writing and running tests to ensure code quality
- Implementing new features or fixing bugs

We strive for 100% test coverage to maintain a robust integration.

## [Translating](translations.md)

Make Powercalc accessible to more users by:

- Adding or improving translations for existing languages via Crowdin
- Requesting support for new languages
- Helping review translations for accuracy

Translations are automatically incorporated into the project, making this an easy way to contribute.
