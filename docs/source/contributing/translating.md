# Translating

You can help by adding missing translations when you are a native speaker.
Or add a complete new language when there is no language file available.

Powercalc uses Crowdin to make contributing easy.

## Changing or adding to existing language

First register and join the translation project.

- Go to <https://crowdin.com>
- When you don't have a crowdin account yet, create one.
- Go to the Crowdin project page: <https://crowdin.com/project/powercalc>
- Click `Join`

Next translate a string.

- Select the language you want to contribute to from the dashboard.
- Click `Translate All`
- Find the string you want to edit, missing translation are marked red.
- Fill in or modify the translation and click `Save`
- Rinse and repeat for other translations.

You are done now.
