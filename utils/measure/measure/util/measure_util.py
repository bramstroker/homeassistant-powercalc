        """
        Measure the average power consumption or resistance for a given time period in seconds.

        This function calculates the average power or resistance by taking multiple readings over
        the specified duration. If `measure_resistance` is True, the function computes resistance
        using the formula R = V^2 / P, where V is the voltage and P is the power. If a dummy load
        resistive value is set, the power consumption of the dummy load calculated for each
        measurement, depending on the current voltage and is subtracted from the power
        measurements.

        Args:
            duration (int): The time duration (in seconds) over which to take measurements.
            measure_resistance (bool): Whether to measure resistance instead of power. Defaults to False.

        Returns:
            float: The average resistance (in Ω) or power (in W) over the measurement duration.

        Raises:
            UnsupportedFeatureError: If `measure_resistance` is True but the power meter does not
                                      support voltage measurements.

        Error handling:
            - If voltage measurements are not supported, the program will terminate with an appropriate
              error message, if measuring power consumption and a dummy load resistive value is set.
            - For resistance measurements, voltage values below 1 are treated as invalid, and the program
              exits to avoid incorrect calculations.
            - Ignores single measurements of <= 0 W.
